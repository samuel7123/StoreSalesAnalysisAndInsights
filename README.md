Our task ;
Examine transaction data – looking  for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If any anomalies are found make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to our analysis. 

Examine customer data – checking for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and  merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

Data analysis and customer segments – in our analysis we define the metrics – looking at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Exploring the data, creating charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report. 

Deep dive into customer segments – defining our recommendation from our insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis.
